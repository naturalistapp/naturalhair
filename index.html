          content="NaturalistApp is a perfect blend of the natural hair community and a holistic hair and lifestyle journey.
The app allows you to share photographs, videos and questions on common hair problems and your progress. You can record memo notes about hair journey milestones, interact with your ‘hair twins’ and rate natural hair products.
By sharing effective products and styling tips, you can develop your own hair care plan rather than take risks with untested products and methods."/>
